The **DINAcon HACKnight** is a way to learn about and contribute to Open Source projects in a hands-on way. This event is open to all, and caters to all levels of technical skill. Our focus will be on all projects nominated and showcased at [DINAcon 2017](http://dinacon.ch/programme), with committers and experts available on hand to guide you through to your first bug report or code commit! [All Challenges posted here](/event/1#top) are announced at the start. Download the [official wallpaper](wallpaper) and get HACKing!

#### Format

Room, refreshments and resources will be provided by our volunteers for mini-sprints starting right after DINAcon, at **18:00 on October 20**. Teams that demonstrate dedication and potential to their hacks may be offered additional time, room and support to continue their projects by representatives of the DINAcon community. Projects may be posted (and remote submissions are welcome) until **18:00 on October 21**.
